## Project Description:

OCRina is a project which combines computer vision, OCR and digital electronics to create a gesture-based BCD calculator.

Using Opencv and Mediapipe, the user writes digits onto a virtual canvas which are then recognised using PyTesseract OCR, the detected numbers are sent to the ESP8266 which output their 2 3-bit binary numbers to a BCD adder haradware circuit built with 7483 adders and 7448 seven-segment decoders.

The system performs real decimal addition and displays the result on physical seven-segment displays.
